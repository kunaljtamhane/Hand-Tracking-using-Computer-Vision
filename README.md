**Hand Tracking Project Using Google Mediapipe**
Welcome to the Hand Tracking project repository! This project utilizes Google's Mediapipe framework to implement a robust hand tracking system, capable of detecting and tracking 20 key landmarks on each hand in real-time.

**Features**
Real-time Hand Detection: Instantly detects hands in real-time, providing immediate feedback even with complex hand movements.
20 Hand Landmarks: Identifies 20 specific landmarks on the hand, including key points on the fingers and palm, enabling detailed hand pose estimation.
High Accuracy and Efficiency: Optimized for accuracy and efficiency, capable of running on various devices including mobile phones and web browsers.
Gesture Recognition: Analyzes the relative positions and movements of the landmarks to recognize various hand gestures, essential for applications such as sign language recognition and human-computer interaction (HCI).
Cross-platform Compatibility: Deployable across multiple platforms, thanks to Mediapipe’s compatibility with Android, iOS, and web technologies.

**Technical Details**
Mediapipe Framework: Utilizes Mediapipe’s pre-trained hand tracking model as the core component.
Landmark Detection: Processes input video frames to detect hands and identify 20 key landmarks:
- Wrist (0)
- Thumb (1-4)
- Index Finger (5-8)
- Middle Finger (9-12)
- Ring Finger (13-16)
- Little Finger (17-20)
Pipeline Optimization: Optimized to reduce latency and increase processing speed for smooth real-time performance.
Gesture Mapping: Custom algorithms map detected landmarks to predefined gestures for gesture recognition.

**Applications**
Sign Language Interpretation: Translate hand signs into text or speech for communication assistance.
Virtual Reality (VR): Enhance user experience with intuitive hand-based interactions in VR environments.
Augmented Reality (AR): Interact with virtual objects overlaid on the real world using hand tracking.
Human-Computer Interaction (HCI): Develop touchless interfaces for controlling applications with hand gestures.
