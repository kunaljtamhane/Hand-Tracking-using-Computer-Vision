# Hand-Tracking-using-Computer-Vision
This project utilizes Google's Mediapipe framework to implement a robust hand tracking system. The system leverages machine learning techniques to detect and track hands in real-time, identifying 20 key landmarks on each hand. These landmarks corresponds to crucial points on the hand, such as finger joints and tips.
